# Bad WebVR Page

# About
Hello this is my very legit WebVR project and not half-baked trash that took two hours to make

# How to Run
You can try it hosted on GitHub pages [here](https://danbolt.github.io/bad-webvr-page/) or run it yourself!

You should be able to use a modern smartphone's web browser, or a WebVR-compatible headset. I used the Oculus Go headset, but I bet one of the bigger cooler ones would render the scene better. Once you've loaded the page, you can click on the little grey goggles icon in the bottom-right corner.

The page is simple HTML and can be hosted on any web server. I typically use the npm package [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) for that kind of stuff (eg: `sudo npm install -g http-server`).

# Technical Stuff for Nerds Like Me
The page uses the [A-Frame library](https://aframe.io) for creating this scene and loading the 3D models. It's very cool and I didn't have to deal with `npm` dependencies, `gem` dependencies, or even `clang` C++17 atomics dependencies to make Gengar jump up and down. What a treat!

# Copyright stuff for Lawyers
Gengar and Porygon are copyrights of Nintendo.
The spinning Nintendo 64 logo is copyright of Nintendo.
